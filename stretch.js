// Stretch Goals

// 1. Write a function that takes a year and reports whether or not it is a leap year.
//     Remember, a leap year occurs:
//        On every year that is evenly divisible by 4
//        Except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
//        Unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
//        For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  1900 is not a leapyear, but 2000 is

// 2. Develop a function that cleans up a phone number entered by a user.
//     The rules are as follows:
//        If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is bad number
//        If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
//        If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1 and use the last 10 digits
//        If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then it is a bad number
//        If the phone number is more than 11 digits assume that it is a bad number



// 3. Create a function that determines whether a parameter is a number or not (Hint: google "isNan")
//     Iterate over the elements in the following array to determine if each is a number.
       arrayOfAllTheThings = ["one", 23, {thingsWhalesLove: "beaches"}, "six hundred", 33, 6834, "5,435"]

// 4. Create a die rolling function that accepts two parameters (the two six-sided dice) and outputs an array of the two values rolled.

// 5. Create another fuction called "whichSide". It will accept the array from above as it's only parameter.
//     This function will mimic a Monopoly board. Start playerOne at the Go space (0) and add the two values from your die array to determine
//     how many spaces the player will move. Log to the console which side of the board the player is on.
//     Hint: each side has 11 spaces. You can call the sides of the board: north, east, south, west or top, right, bottom, left.

// 6. Using the game above, use the same function(s) and add additional code to determine if the player is on a corner spot.
//     Log to the console which corner the player is located.
